## The Research Question

Modern defense often treats the **Host** (OS/Process) and the **Network** (Packet/Wire) as separate silos. This research portfolio explores the **composition** of these two domains to create a unified defense architecture.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Track 1: Sentinel Runtime" icon="linux">
    **Domain:** Host / Process / Syscall
    <br/>
    **Mechanism:** `ptrace` + Anomaly Detection
    <br/>
    **Focus:** Enforcing intent at the execution boundary. Sentinel prevents unauthorized syscall patterns and behavioral anomalies.

  <Card title="Track 2: Hyperion (Network)" icon="rocket">
    **Domain:** Network / Driver / Packet
    <br/>
    **Mechanism:** `eBPF` + `XDP`
    <br/>
    **Focus:** Enforcing policy at the wire. Hyperion rejects malicious traffic in the NIC driver before the OS allocates memory.
