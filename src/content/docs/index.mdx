## System Status: M2.0 (Experimental)

**Sentinel Runtime** is a research-grade EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response) system. It intercepts Linux system calls to enforce semantic security policies in real-time.

Unlike standard syscall monitors, Sentinel M2.0 features **Recursive Process Tracking**, allowing it to monitor entire process trees (shells, scripts, and child processes) without losing context.

		A high-performance `ptrace` engine that handles <b>PTRACE_EVENT_FORK</b> to automatically attach to child processes.

		A WiSARD Weightless Neural Network that evaluates execution context against a semantic policy.

		<b>Active Blocking.</b> Sentinel neutralizes malicious syscalls by injecting <code>ENOSYS</code> error codes at the kernel boundary.

        <b>New in M2.0:</b> Zero-blind-spot monitoring. Sentinel now sees "Grandchild" processes (e.g., bash spawning python spawning ransomware).
