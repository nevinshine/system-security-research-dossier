## The Research Question

Modern defense often treats the **Host** (OS), the **Network** (Wire), and **AI Agents** (Intent) as separate silos. This research portfolio explores the **composition** of these three domains to create a unified, intent-based defense architecture.

---

### Track 1: Sentinel Runtime (Host)

**Domain:** Host / Process / Syscall
<br/>
**Mechanism:** `ptrace` + Anomaly Detection
<br/>
**Focus:** Enforcing intent at the execution boundary. Sentinel prevents unauthorized syscall patterns and behavioral anomalies.

### Track 2: Hyperion (Network)

**Domain:** Network / Driver / Packet
<br/>
**Mechanism:** `eBPF` + `XDP`
<br/>
**Focus:** Enforcing policy at the wire. Hyperion rejects malicious traffic in the NIC driver before the OS allocates memory.

### Track 3: Telos (AI Security)

**Domain:** AI Agents / LLM / Intent
<br/>
**Mechanism:** `eBPF LSM` + `LLM Verification`
<br/>
**Focus:** Preventing Indirect Prompt Injection by aligning system calls with high-level intent.

### Field Notes (Side Research)

**Status:** Exploratory / Academic
<br/>
**Focus:** Analysis of emerging threats and technologies (e.g., Post-Quantum Cryptography) beyond the core engineering tracks.

## About the Researcher

**Nevin** is an **Undergraduate Systems Researcher** focused on the intersection of **Runtime Enforcement** and **Kernel Datapath Security**.

Currently a Computer Science & Engineering student at **AJCE (Kanjirapally)**, he is a German citizen building unified defense architectures that close the semantic gap between high-level intent and low-level execution.

### Core Competencies

#### Systems Programming (C / eBPF)
* **Kernel Hooks:** Experience with ptrace for syscall interception and XDP (eXpress Data Path) for nanosecond-scale packet filtering.
* **Memory Safety:** Writing hook-safe C code for eBPF verifiers (bounded loops, stack limits).
* **Low-Level Linux:** Deep understanding of the proc filesystem, namespaces, and standard streams.

#### Security Engineering
* **Sentinel Runtime:** Architected a host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) capable of identifying logical anomalies in process execution trees.
* **Hyperion Firewall:** Designed a stateful firewall operating entirely in the NIC driver context using eBPF maps.
* **Telos Architecture:** Pioneering "Intent-Based" security for Autonomous AI Agents.

#### Full-Stack & Tooling
* **Languages:** Python (Analysis Engines), Java (Spring), Go (Daemons).
* **DevOps:** Docker containerization for isolated agent environments.
* **Research:** Active contributor to the open-source security community with a focus on reproducibility.
