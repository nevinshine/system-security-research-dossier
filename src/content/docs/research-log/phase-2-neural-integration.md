# Phase 2: Neural Integration (Days 16–Current)

**Status:** ✅ Milestone M2.0 Reached (Recursive Engine)
**Focus:** Active Defense, Deep Introspection, and Recursive Process Tracking.

While Phase 1 focused on the **Foundations** (Trace, Block, Train), Phase 2 is about **Connection** and **Coverage**. We have bridged the C-based Kernel Monitor with the Python-based AI and eliminated the critical "Grandchild Blind Spot," resulting in a fully operational **Recursive Active Defense System**.

## Progress Log

### Day 24: Research Architecture Standardization
**Goal:** Elevate codebase from "Student Prototype" to "Research Artifact".

We performed a "Surgical Refactor" of the entire repository to meet academic engineering standards.
* **Modularization:** Decoupled the Monolithic Kernel Logic (`src/engine`) from the Policy Analysis Brain (`src/analysis`).
* **Automation:** Replaced manual GCC scripts with a standard `Makefile` build system for reproducible compilation.
* **Verification:** Established a standardized `tests/evasion` suite for benchmarking malware vectors.
* **Outcome:** The system is now architecturally stable for Universal Argument Extraction (Phase 6).

### Day 23: Recursive Process Tracking (M2.0)
**Goal:** Eliminate the "Grandchild Blind Spot" using `PTRACE_O_TRACEFORK`.

We upgraded the Sentinel Kernel Engine to automatically track process lineages.
* **The Problem:** Standard tracing missed child processes spawned by shells (e.g., `bash` -> `python3` -> `malware`).
* **The Fix:** Implemented `PTRACE_O_TRACEFORK` to auto-attach to any new child.
* **The Result:** Sentinel now sees the entire "Process Tree." Policies applied to the parent are automatically inherited by the children.
* **Milestone:** Tagged release `M2.0` (Recursive Process Tree Tracking).

### Day 22: Semantic Orchestration (M1.2)
**Goal:** Unify the "Brain" and "Body" into a single executable platform.

We integrated the C-Engine and Python-Brain into a cohesive platform.
* **Refinement:** Patched the `mkdirat` blind spot by leveraging the semantic engine to inspect directory paths relative to file descriptors.
* **The "Eye" Upgrade:** Finalized the `PTRACE_PEEKDATA` logic to reliably extract string arguments from child processes without race conditions.
* **Milestone:** Tagged release `M1.2` (Active Semantic Platform).

### Day 21: Active Blocking (The Kill Switch)
**Goal:** Close the feedback loop and enforce the AI's verdict.

We implemented the **Kernel-Level Policy Enforcer**.
* **Mechanism:** When the Neural Network returns `BLOCK`, the C-Engine intercepts the paused syscall and injects `-1` into the `ORIG_RAX` register.
* **Result:** The Kernel returns `ENOSYS` (Function Not Implemented), effectively neutralizing the threat without crashing the process.
* **Significance:** Sentinel is no longer just a monitor; it is an **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)**.

### Day 20: Live Neural Defense (M1.0)
**Goal:** Validate the synchronous "Cybernetic Loop" (C $\to$ IPC $\to$ Python $\to$ Verdict).

We successfully integrated the **WiSARD (Weightless Neural Network)** into the IPC listener. The system now performs real-time inference on incoming syscall streams.
* **The Test:** Conducted a "Red/Green" verification.
    * Input: `mkdir` (Benign) $\to$ Verdict: `✅ BENIGN`
    * Input: `rootkit_install` (Anomaly) $\to$ Verdict: `🚨 ANOMALY`
* **Result:** Achieved **< 1ms latency** for the full detection loop.

## Upcoming Objectives (Phase 3)

* **Universal Argument Extraction (Phase 6):** Decoupling the engine from hardcoded syscalls to support a universal `syscall_map` (detecting `connect`, `unlink`, `execve`).
* **Behavioral Sequence Analysis:** Moving beyond single-event blocking to detect *sequences* of behavior (e.g., "Open $\to$ Read $\to$ Encrypt $\to$ Write").
* **Container Hardening:** Testing Sentinel against Docker container escapes.
